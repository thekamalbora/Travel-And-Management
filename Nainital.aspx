Commonly known as the "Lake District of India", Nainital is one of the most beautiful hill stations in North India. Surrounded by mountains on three sides Nainital is located around the beautiful lake Naini Tal. This lake resort is situated at a height of 1,938 meters. There are many legends associated with the place. According to one, Nainital has derived its name from the Goddess Naina while the other legend says that when the Goddess Sati lost her eyes, she was being carried by Lord Shiva and a lake was formed. ('Naina' means eyes and 'Tal' means lake.) This beautiful small town in surrounded by seven hills, popularly known as 'Sapta-Shring' - Ayarpata, Deopata, Handi-Bandi, Naina, Alma, Lariya-Kanta and Sher-Ka-Danda. The majestic mountains and the sparkling waters of the lake add an immense lot to the beauty of the town.</p>
                                                    <p>The city is a beautiful mixture of all the hues of nature. Naini lake is the pride Nainital and the many gaily coloured yachts on the sparkling lake have now become synonymous with this beautiful picture-postcard resort. A national level yachting competition is organized here during the season.</p>
                                                    <p>Nainital used to be the summer capital of United Provinces (Uttar Pradesh) during the British era and remained so for many years even after Independence. The British were the first to 'discover' Nainital as a holiday resort in 1841. Today, it has grown into a highly popular tourist destination. The emerald waters of this mountain lake continue to retain their charm and beckon tourists from far and wide.</p>
                                                    <p>Once this area had many lakes and it was called the region of 60 lakes. Most of the lakes in the region have gradually disappeared and whatever remains is just a glimpse of what they might have been in the past. Today the life of Nainital revolves around the lake Naini though in close proximity lie other lakes e.g. Bhimtal, Naukuchiatal, Sattal etc. These picturesque lakes have retained their charm and the region is justifiably called The Lake District.</p>
                                                    <p>Nainital has an advantage of being situated in vicinity of several other lesser known hill stations that are connected through all season motorable roads.Vantage points around Nainital offer a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks on one side and the plains spread out on the other. Narrow wooded lanes through forests of oak, pine and deodar are excellent for short refreshing walks. The older parts of Nainital also retain colonial vestiges, including sprawling bungalows, public schools, churches and the old Christian cemetery.</p>
                                                    <p>On reaching the head of the town where the highway from the plains meets the main Mall at Tallital, one gets a dramatic view of the beautiful Naini Lake that seems to be nestled in a remote cocoon. Brightly coloured sails of yachts dot the calm waters of the lake while crowds of holiday makers throng the Mall at its edge. Boating in the lake is just one of the favourite activities of the tourists. Others come here for trekking in the densely forested mountains that surround the town.</p>

                                            In a mythological account, this picturesque lake is said to be one of the emerald green eyes of Shiva's beloved consort, Sati (nain is a Sanskrit word for eye). When Sati's father failed to invite Shiva to a family sacrifice, she burnt herself to death in protest. Shiva gathered the charred remains in his arms and proceeded to engage in a cosmic dance tandav, which threatened to destroy the creation. To bring the dance to an end, Vishnu chopped up the body into pieces, and the remains were scattered. The Naina Devi Temple at the northern end of the lake is built over the precise spot where the eye is believed to have fallen.

                                        <p><h3>Nainital in Summer (March - June)     </h3></p>
                                         <p>The summer begins in Nainital from mid-March, and so does the peak season of tourism. This is the best time to visit this town, as the climate is quite pleasant and the weather favorable. However, the afternoons can be a bit nauseating owing to the heat factor, so it is advisable to do boating from 16:00 onwards. The temperature varies from 10 to 25 degrees Celcius.  </p>

                                         <p><h3>Nainital in Monsoon (July - September)</h3></p>
                                         <p>This is not exactly the best time to visit this town. The town is soaked during this season, and being on a hilly terrain, road blockages are a part and a parcel for this reason. However, since this is the off-season, hotels and rest houses offer huge discounts, and for the budget travelers, this is the right time to strike gold.    </p>

                                          <p><h3>Nainital in Winter (October - February)</h3></p>
                                         <p>Winter starts setting into the town of Nainital from October onwards, which is probably the last month where a visit to the town is welcome. The climate is once again pleasant, although there is a certain chill in the air in the night. November onwards, the climate starts turning misty, and unless you're a snow lover, the months from December onwards are certainly not the best months to visit Nainital.  </p>
