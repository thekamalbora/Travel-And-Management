                                                <p>Nestled in the mountain ranges of the Himalayas, Dehradun is the capital of Uttarakhand. It is one of the most beautiful resorts in the sub mountain tracks of India, known for its scenic surroundings. The name Dehradun is a collection of two words "dera" meaning camp and " dun" meaning valley.

Said to be one of the oldest cities in India, it is believed that Lord Rama and his brother did penance here for killing Ravana, the demon king. During the 17th and 18th centuries Dehradun changed hands several times: Guru Ram Rai retreated here from Punjab, the Mughal Governor Najib-ud-Daula occupied it from 1757-1770 and the Gorkhas overran it on their westward expansion before ceding it to the British in 1815. Under the British, Dehradun became an elite town with many a fine institutions like Forest Research Institute, Doon School and Welham Schools for girls and boys, many more, like the ONGC and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Studies, were added in time. Dehradun has now become an important tourist destination.</p>

                                        <p><h3>Dehradun in Winter (November - March)</h3></p>
                                         <p>This is the least advisable time for a visit, owing to the frigid temperatures. However, if you're a snow enthusiast, and are raring to go, then it is advisable that you set off with proper precautions, especially in the case of clothes. You should be packed with woolens for the same. </p>

                                         <p><h3>Dehradun in Summer (April - June)</h3></p>
                                         <p>This is the peak season for tourism in Dehradun and also an ideal season for a visit for the same. The climate is pleasant, the ambiance is lovely, and the calmness is just right for the peace seekers. The temperature lowers during the night, which is a big relief from the blazing summers, especially in the northern region of India.   </p>

                                          <p><h3>Dehradun in Monsoon & Autumn (July - October)</h3></p>
                                         <p>The monsoon season is lovely, especially when it drizzles, making Dehradun a beautiful place to visit. However, being a hilly region, this is not exactly the ideal season for a visit, owing to the risk of landslides and possible floods. The season turns ideal once again from late September, when the clouds subside and the nights turn pleasant, with a certain chill in the air. </p>
