If you walk past the clock tower and look between the plains and the rising slopes of Landour, you'll see a road that leads to the green meadows and deodar forests of Dhanaulti, 24 km away. There's both a forest bungalow and a tourist bungalow at Dhanaulti and it's a delightful place to spend a quiet weekend.
